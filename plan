Wood:
-buildings
-tools

Iron:
-buildings
-tools



agent:
-moves around world
-has vehicle (default to none)
-vehicle controls capacity and speed


inputs:
    building info:
      -owned by agent?
      -capacity remaining
      -building-type
    price sensor:
      -(for each item) how much it is for sale
      -(for each item) how much is available
    self info:
      -how much money I have
      -(for each item) how much I have
      -my hunger
      -am I in a vehicle?
    cell info:
      -(for each resouce) amount

outputs: costs hunger
    -movement
    -move from inventory to building (float determining amount)
    -item selector float (each item gets an equal range in 0.0-1.0)
    -move from building to inventory (float determing amount)
    -buy (float determing amount)
    -enter/exit vehicle
    -sell price modifier (used to set price of item moved into shop)

-amount of money
-lot resource density for each resource
-amount of item in possession
-amount of item in square
-lot type (boolean)
-own square (boolean)
-current x
-current y

outputs:
-move up/down/left/right
-take amount (0 = don't take)
-buy amount (0 = don't buy)
-buy lot (must be for sale)
-store (enough space in building required, will be for sale in shops)
-harvest resource
-build (integer defines what)
-demolish
-produce (must have required items in warehouse)
-get in vehicle (must own vehicle and be on the same square)
-get out of vehicle

evaluation:
-how much money they make
-make $X to reproduce
-how many days survived

simulation runs in rounds, after each round all of the agents involved are evaluated.
the highest evaluated ones are genetically crossed and used to populate the next round, along with some random agents
